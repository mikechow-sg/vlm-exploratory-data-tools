VLM Annotation for column: shot_scale_vlm_1b_01
Model: qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct 
Prompt: You are an expert annotator with a focus on cinematography. Analyze the provided image and classify its shot scale into these mutually exclusive categories with the following definitions: Empty: frame has no discernible subject or focus, showing only the setting or environment; WS (Wide Shot): subject can be seen in full with the background dominating them; FS (Full Shot): subject fully visible from head to toe. The background is less prominent in full shots than wide shots; MFS (Medium Full Shot): subject is framed from the knees up; MS (Medium Shot): subject is framed from the waist up; MCU (Medium Close‑Up): subject framed from the chest up; CU (Close‑Up): subject is framed from the head up to the shoulders and takes up most of the frame. However, if you are uncertain, return 'uncertain'. Return only one of these labels: 'Empty', 'WS', 'FS', 'MFS', 'MS', 'MCU', 'CU' or 'Uncertain'.

VLM Annotation for column: shot_scale_vlm_1b_07
Model: qwen2-vl-7b-instruct 
Prompt: You are an expert annotator with a focus on cinematography. Analyze the provided image and classify its shot scale into these mutually exclusive categories with the following definitions: Empty: frame has no discernible subject or focus, showing only the setting or environment; WS (Wide Shot): subject can be seen in full with the background dominating them; FS (Full Shot): subject fully visible from head to toe. The background is less prominent in full shots than wide shots; MFS (Medium Full Shot): subject is framed from the knees up; MS (Medium Shot): subject is framed from the waist up; MCU (Medium Close‑Up): subject framed from the chest up; CU (Close‑Up): subject is framed from the head up to the shoulders and takes up most of the frame. However, if you are uncertain, return 'uncertain'. Return only one of these labels: 'Empty', 'WS', 'FS', 'MFS', 'MS', 'MCU', 'CU' or 'Uncertain'.

VLM Annotation for column: shot_scale_vlm_1b_04_tuple 
Model: qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct 
Prompt: You are an expert annotator with a focus on cinematography. Analyze the provided image and classify its shot scale into these mutually exclusive categories with the following definitions: Empty: frame has no discernible subject or focus, showing only the setting or environment; WS (Wide Shot): subject can be seen in full with the background dominating them; FS (Full Shot): subject fully visible from head to toe. The background is less prominent in full shots than wide shots; MFS (Medium Full Shot): subject is framed from the knees up; MS (Medium Shot): subject is framed from the waist up; MCU (Medium Close‑Up): subject framed from the chest up; CU (Close‑Up): subject is framed from the head up to the shoulders and takes up most of the frame. However, if you are uncertain, return 'uncertain'. Respond with a Python-style tuple in the format: ('classification', 'motivation' - ‘classification’ must be one of: 'Empty', 'WS', 'FS', 'MFS', 'MS', 'MCU', 'CU' or 'Uncertain'; ‘motivation’ is a justification of your classification in 50 words or fewer, explaining what visual elements in the image led to your choice or uncertainty.

Prompt: You are an expert annotator with a focus on cinematography. You are provided a still image from a scene in a video posted on the Israel Defence Force’s TikTok between 7 October 2023 to 7 October 2024. Your analysis of its shot scale will enable understanding of cinematographic patterns in their videos. Analyze the provided image and classify its shot scale using the following definitions: Empty: frame has no discernible subject or focus, showing only the setting or environment; Wide shot: subject can be seen in full with the background dominating them; Full shot: subject fully visible from head to toe. The background is less prominent in full shots than wide shots; Medium full shot: subject is framed from the knees up; Medium shot: subject framed from the waist up; Medium close up: subject framed from the chest up; Close up: subject is framed from the head up to the shoulders and takes up most of the frame. However, if you are uncertain, return 'Uncertain'. Return only one of these labels: 'Empty', 'Wide shot', 'Full shot', 'Medium full shot', 'Medium shot', 'Medium close up', 'Close up' or 'Uncertain'. What is the shot scale of this still image?

Respond with a Python-style tuple in the format: (’classification’, ‘motivation’) - ‘classification’ must be one of: ‘Empty’, ‘Wide shot’, ‘Full shot’, ‘Medium full shot’, ‘Medium shot’, ‘Medium close up’, ‘Close up’, ‘Selfie’ or ‘Uncertain’. ‘motivation’ is a justification of your classification in 50 words or fewer, explaining what visual elements in the image led to your choice or uncertainty. What is the shot scale of this still image?

Prompt: You are an expert annotator of social media videos. You are provided a still image from a scene in a video posted on the Israel Defence Force’s TikTok between 7 October 2023 to 7 October 2024. Your analysis of the setting of the image will enable understanding of the production process of their videos. Your job is to analyze the backdrop of the image and identify if there are explicit signs of combat in the setting. You will classify the image into the following three mutually exclusive categories. Ignore any overlaid text, captions or the clothes people are wearing. For the provided image, select the one category that best describes its the presence of combat: Graphics: Image is not live‑action footage or is artificial (e.g. animations, CGI, black screens) and hence cannot discernibly have combat presence; Combat: Image contains explicit signs of warfare, such as visible destruction, rubble, military hardware, weapons, traces of combat or troops in the background (excluding the speaker); Non-combat: Image does not contain explicit signs of warfare, destruction or traces of combat. Analyze the provided still and reply with one of these exact labels: 'Graphics', 'Combat' or 'Non-combat'.

VLM Annotation for column: location_vlm_01 
Model: qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct 
Prompt: You are an expert annotator of social media videos. You are provided a still image from a scene in a video posted on the Israel Defence Force’s TikTok between 7 October 2023 to 7 October 2024. Your analysis of the setting of the image will enable understanding of their tendencies in their video production processes. Your job is to analyze the backdrop of the image and classify it into the following three mutually exclusive location labels. Ignore overlaid text or captions that may inform your classification. For the provided image, select the one category that best describes its setting: Graphics: Image is not live‑action footage or is artificial (e.g., animations, CGI, black screens) and hence cannot be discernably set in a location; Outdoor: Image is set outdoors with natural lighting and where natural landscapes or exteriors of urban environments may be visible; Indoors: Image is set indoors, where the backdrop is in interior locations or permanent structures such as studios, rooms and in confined spaces (eg tunnels). Artificial lighting may also be present. Analyze the provided still image and reply with one of these exact labels: 'Graphics', 'Outdoor' or 'Indoor'.
